# FARM CONNECT

## Revolutionizing Conventional Produce Selling Method

### Summary

FARM CONNECT addresses a critical issue in agricultural commerce: farmers are typically restricted to selling their produce in local markets with fixed prices controlled by middlemen. This limitation severely impacts profit potential and prevents farmers from negotiating fair prices for their crops.

Our platform breaks this cycle by creating a digital marketplace where farmers can showcase their produce quality to a wider audience, bypass middlemen, and connect directly with buyers. By introducing competition among buyers and expanding market access, FARM CONNECT helps farmers escape the underpayment trap and receive fair value for their hard work.

## Key Features

### Interactive Proximity Map
Our flagship feature is the integrated proximity map that:
- Shows sellers all nearby potential buyers in their region
- Shows buyers all nearby farmers with available produce
- Calculates and displays the exact distance between sellers and buyers
- Provides detailed profile information via interactive modals
- Displays contact details for direct communication
- Enables filtering based on distance and product preferences

This robust mapping system eliminates geographical barriers by connecting farmers with buyers they might never discover otherwise, optimizing local supply chains and reducing transportation costs.
